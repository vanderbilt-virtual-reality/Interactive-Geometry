# Interactive-Geometry

## Summary
Virtual Reality project as part of Vanderbilt CS course. Working in a team of 4 in collaboration with Professor Corey Brady to create an interactive experience to help visualize and interact with 3D mathematical geometry. 



## Goals
Allow students to visualize in VR 3D space mathematical concepts in geometry. For example, we want to allow students to dynamically extend the volume of a cylinder or cube via VR interaction.
